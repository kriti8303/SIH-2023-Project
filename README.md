# SIH-2023-Project
## Project Overview:
Developed a comprehensive digital solution for Non-Revenue Water (NRW) reduction and leakage detection, leveraging machine learning algorithms to predict and identify areas with high water loss. Created an interactive dashboard to visualize real-time data related to water distribution and NRW, providing insights for effective decision-making. Additionally, the system integrated GIS mapping to pinpoint leak locations and designed a billing system dashboard to track water usage, enhance billing accuracy, and reduce revenue loss.
## Step By Step Process:
1. Research and Assessment:
* Conduct a comprehensive study to understand existing water supply challenges, NRW sources, and technology requirements.
2. Data Transmission:
* When acoustic sensors are equipped with communication modules (such as Wi-Fi, cellular, or other connectivity solutions), they can transmit the collected data wirelessly to a central system or cloud platform.
3. Remote Monitoring:
* By connecting acoustic sensors to the internet, users can remotely monitor and analyze the collected acoustic data in real-time. This allows for timely responses to anomalies, such as detecting leaks in a water distribution network.
4. Integration with IoT Platforms:
* Acoustic sensors can be integrated into larger IoT platforms or systems. These platforms often include analytics tools, visualization dashboards, and other features that enhance the management and interpretation of sensor data.
5. Enhancing Efficiency:
* The integration of acoustic sensors into an IoT ecosystem can contribute to more efficient and proactive management of infrastructure. For example, in the context of water distribution networks, acoustic sensors can help detect leaks early, minimizing water losses.

## Billing System Components: 
1. Meter Reading:
* Use smart meters or traditional meters to measure water consumption accurately.
2. Rate Structure:
* Define a transparent and fair rate structure for water consumption.
3. Billing Cycle:
* Establish a billing cycle for invoicing consumers regularly (e.g., monthly or quarterly).
4. Billing Accuracy:
* Implement mechanisms to ensure billing accuracy and reduce errors.

## Visualization in Power BI:
1. Total Revenue:
* Display a key metric showing the total revenue generated from water billing.
2. Revenue Breakdown:
* Create a pie chart or stacked bar chart to illustrate the distribution of revenue across different billing categories (e.g., authorized bills, unauthorized bills, data entry errors).
3. Billing Trends Over Time:
* Utilize line charts or area charts to showcase trends in total revenue over different time periods.
4. MeterId Analysis:
* Use tables or charts to display billing information for each MeterId.
5. WaterAccount Analysis:
* Analyze billing data for each WaterAccount, emphasizing outstanding balances or overages.
6. Metrics and KPIs:
* Create key performance indicators (KPIs) such as average revenue per user, total revenue growth rate, or percentage of unauthorized bills.
7. Comparative Analysis:
* Compare billing data across different time periods or regions.
